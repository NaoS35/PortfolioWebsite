# Responsive Web Page Tutorial Practice.
This is my first front-end project, created based on a tutorial to learn the basics of HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.
To add a unique touch, I customized the project by implementing a JavaScript feature that makes the character in the profile icon follow the mouse with its eyes.
This customization was a great opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of how to use event listeners, DOM manipulation, and dynamic styling in a real-world context.

## Demo

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla JS)

## Based on Tutorial
This project was based on a tutorial from [Pro Coder](https://youtu.be/-u3vE84Wo_U?si=eZ7B8kPQ0fzCOvSU).

## Things I Focused on While Working on This Project.
since I only started learning front-end development recently, my main focus was on getting a hands-on feel for how things connect, rather than understanding every detail.
I aimed to grasp the core ideas and structure of programming, rather than focusing too much on syntax.
This project gave me a solid starting point and helped boost my confidence going forward.

## Future Plans
- Customize the UI to give it a more original look and feel.
- Add more interactive animations using JavaScript.
- Connect links to make the site more functional.
